        Hey! My name is <strong>Tzuriel Yeffet</strong> and I'm currently
        working as a Kotlin developer for <em>General Motors</em>. While I enjoy
        mobile development, I'm now diving into full stack development to expand
        my skills and explore web technologies. I've always been the type of
        person who loves figuring out how things work, and I'm excited to learn
        how front-end and back-end systems work together to create complete
        applications that people can actually use.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <hr class="hr-style">
    <p>
      When I'm not working on my computer, you'll probably find me hanging out
      with my wife and kids, watching Netflix, or diving into learning something
      new. I'm also really into martial arts and playing guitar.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <hr class="hr-style">
      <p>
        Right now, my main goal is pretty straightforward - I want to become
        skilled enough at full stack development to build reliable and scalable
        systems. I'm hoping to eventually transition into a full stack developer
        role,<strong>
          but for now I'm just focused on learning as much as I can and becoming
          the best developer I can be.</strong

        <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Over the next few months, I'm planning to work through this course,
          build some projects for my portfolio, and maybe start contributing to
          open source projects once I feel confident enough. I know it's going
          to be challenging, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
